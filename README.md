# Leo Lewis Comp2000 Coursework

## About the project
This project is my completed project for Comp2000. It is an android app that allows admins of a company to make requests to an api using a GUI instead of through code. It has the ability to show the user all the current users in the database, let the admin create a new user, let the admin update an existing user and lets the admin delete a user

## Packages used
[Volley](https://github.com/google/volley) to simplify making requests from the API

## Using the app
To use the app the user has to fill in the boxes in the correct section and then press the plus button in the title bar of the specific section other than to show all employees where the user just has to press the arrow and then can scroll through all the names that appear
